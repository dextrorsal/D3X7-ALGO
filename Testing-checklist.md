- `test_create_test_market`: Skipped due to missing module
  - **Reason**: No module named 'solana.publickey'
  - **Fix needed**: Install the solana package or fix import paths

- `test_execute_test_trade`: Skipped due to missing module
  - **Reason**: Same as above, dependent on the market creation test

#### 2. Websocket and Event Loop Errors
Many tests show errors related to websockets and event loops:
- `RuntimeError: no running event loop` errors in websocket connections
- `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file` errors in logging
- These errors don't prevent tests from passing but should be fixed for cleaner test output

#### 3. Import Path Issues
Several test modules have import path issues:
- `src.utils.indicators.wrapper_supertrend`
- `core.config`
- `src.utils.wallet.wallet_cli`
- `src.utils.log_setup`
- `src.trading.drift.account_manager`
- `src.trading.devnet.drift_account_manager`
- `src.trading.jup.account_manager`

**Fix needed**: Check and update import paths in the affected modules.

#### 4. DriftHandler Exchange Tests
Four DriftHandler tests are failing due to timeout:
- `test_get_markets`
- `test_get_exchange_info`
- `test_fetch_historical_candles`
- `test_fetch_live_candles`

**Reason**: Timeout when connecting to Drift API
**Fix needed**: Configure proper API timeout or use test mode for these tests

#### 5. Core Tests
The core unit tests are failing due to import issues:
- `test_core.py` - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.utils.log_setup'
- `test_symbol_mapper.py` - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'
- `test_critical_functionality.py` - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'

#### 6. Wallet Encryption Test
The wallet encryption test fails with:
- AttributeError: 'Command' object has no attribute '__code__'
- This appears to be an issue with the test structure rather than the encryption functionality

#### 7. GUI Test
The GUI test (`test_qt.py`) doesn't have any actual tests defined:
- No tests were collected

#### 8. Indicator Tests
Several indicator tests are failing with import errors:
- `simple_indicator_test.py` - No module named 'utils.indicators.wrapper_rsi'
- `test_data_fetching_indicators.py` - 'RawDataStorage' object has no attribute 'get_candles'

#### 9. Functional Tests Import Issues
- `test_critical_functionality.py` has import issues:
  - Missing 'core' module
  - Appears to be from a different project structure (references "ultimate_data_fetcher")
  - Needs path adjustments to work in the current project structure

#### 10. Mainnet Tests Import Issues
- Both `test_mainnet_trade.py` and `test_mainnet_swap.py` have the same import issue:
  - Missing 'src.utils.wallet.wallet_cli' module
  - These tests reference import paths from the main project structure that may not exist or have changed
  - Fix needed: Update import paths or implement the necessary modules

#### 11. Security Tests Issues
- `test_security_manager.py` has import issues with relative imports
- Websocket connections in `test_security_integration.py` are not being properly closed, resulting in multiple warnings
- The wallet encryption test can't be run with pytest but works as a direct script

#### 12. Storage Tests Issues
- Most storage tests have import path issues, especially for the indicator modules
- DriftHandler tests timeout when attempting to connect to external APIs
- 'RawDataStorage' interface mismatch - get_candles vs. load_candles
- Indicator modules have deprecated usage of pandas Series.__getitem__
- RSI indicator implementation is missing a debug attribute

### 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

## 📊 Updated Conclusion (2025-03-22)

After running and analyzing tests across multiple directories in the D3X7-ALGO project, we have a comprehensive picture of the testing status:

1. **Working Core Components**:
   - **Wallet Integration**: All wallet-related functionality works correctly when tested with the proper flags
   - **DevnetAdapter**: Core devnet adapter functionality is working properly
   - **Storage**: Basic storage functionality passes all tests, with raw and processed data storage working correctly
   - **Security Limits**: Position size, leverage limits, and emergency shutdown functionality works correctly

2. **Visualization & UI Components**:
   - **Visualization Tools**: The visualization helper successfully generates and saves plots
   - **PyQt6 Interface**: Basic PyQt6 functionality works when run directly

3. **Exchange Integrations**:
   - **Binance Handler**: All Binance tests pass successfully 
   - **Drift Integration**: Most functionality works but has timeout issues with external APIs
   - **Jupiter Integration**: Connection, price retrieval, and quote generation work correctly

4. **Persistent Issues**:
   - **Import Path Problems**: Many tests fail due to inconsistent import paths across the codebase
   - **External API Dependencies**: Tests that call external APIs often timeout or fail when networks are unavailable
   - **Test Directory Structure**: The run_tests.py expects a different directory structure than what exists
   - **Websocket Cleanup**: Many tests leave websocket connections open, causing warnings

5. **Critical Areas for Improvement**:
   - **Standardize Import Paths**: Create a consistent approach to imports across the codebase
   - **Implement Proper Mocking**: External API calls should be mocked for reliable testing
   - **Update Test Runner**: Either update run_tests.py to match the current directory structure or reorganize tests
   - **Fix Resource Cleanup**: Ensure websocket connections and event loops are properly cleaned up

The project has solid core functionality with most basic components working correctly. The main issues revolve around project structure, import paths, and proper handling of external dependencies rather than fundamental functionality problems.

**Priority Recommendations**:
1. Standardize the import pattern across all modules
2. Create a testing environment with mocked external dependencies
3. Reorganize test directories to match the expected structure or update run_tests.py
4. Implement proper resource cleanup in all tests that use external resources

**Note**: This checklist was updated on 2025-03-22 and reflects the current state of the tests after our fixes.
