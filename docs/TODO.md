# Ultimate Data Fetcher - Focused TODO List üéØ

## Phase 1: Drift & Jupiter Integration Completion üåü
### Drift Protocol Setup
- [ ] Test account balance checking on devnet
  ```python
  # Example check in check_balance.py
  balance = await drift_client.get_balance()
  print(f"Current balance: {balance}")
  ```
- [ ] Verify position opening/closing on devnet
- [ ] Test order placement with small amounts
- [ ] Document all working Drift functions

### Jupiter Integration
- [ ] Confirm swap routes are working
- [ ] Test price quotes on devnet
- [ ] Verify slippage settings
- [ ] Document Jupiter functions

### Testing & Safety
- [ ] Run all devnet tests multiple times
- [ ] Check error handling works
- [ ] Verify logging is helpful
- [ ] Test emergency stop function

## Phase 2: Moving to Mainnet üöÄ
### Safety First
- [ ] Double-check all balance calculations
- [ ] Verify position size limits work
- [ ] Test emergency stop on devnet again
- [ ] Review all error messages

### Mainnet Testing
- [ ] Set up mainnet with tiny amounts
- [ ] Test Drift functions with small positions
- [ ] Verify Jupiter swaps with minimum amounts
- [ ] Monitor first 24 hours of operation

### Documentation
- [ ] Write down mainnet deployment steps
- [ ] Document all configuration settings
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Make checklist for daily monitoring

## Phase 3: Strategy Implementation üìà
### Basic Strategy Setup
- [ ] Create simple MA crossover strategy
  ```python
  class SimpleStrategy:
      async def should_trade(self):
          price = await self.get_price()
          ma = await self.get_moving_average()
          return price > ma
  ```
- [ ] Test strategy on devnet
- [ ] Add basic position sizing
- [ ] Implement stop-loss

### Strategy Testing
- [ ] Backtest strategy with historical data
- [ ] Paper trade on devnet
- [ ] Track win/loss ratio
- [ ] Monitor drawdown

### Live Trading
- [ ] Start with minimum position sizes
- [ ] Monitor strategy performance
- [ ] Track all trades in log
- [ ] Review daily results

## Phase 4: ML Pipeline Preparation ü§ñ
### Data Collection
- [ ] Set up price data storage
  ```python
  # Example data structure
  data = {
      'timestamp': [],
      'price': [],
      'volume': [],
      'indicators': []
  }
  ```
- [ ] Store indicator values
- [ ] Save trade results
- [ ] Organize data for training

### Basic ML Setup
- [ ] Install PyTorch or TensorFlow
- [ ] Create simple data preprocessing
- [ ] Set up basic RNN structure
- [ ] Prepare training pipeline

### Initial ML Testing
- [ ] Train on historical data
- [ ] Test predictions
- [ ] Compare with current strategy
- [ ] Document results

## Daily Checklist ‚úÖ
### Morning
- [ ] Check all balances
- [ ] Verify systems are running
- [ ] Look for any errors in logs
- [ ] Check strategy performance

### Evening
- [ ] Review day's trades
- [ ] Check profit/loss
- [ ] Backup important data
- [ ] Plan next day's improvements

## Tips for Success üí°
1. **Take Small Steps**
   - Test everything on devnet first
   - Use minimum amounts on mainnet
   - Document what works

2. **Stay Safe**
   - Double-check all numbers
   - Keep good records
   - Don't rush to mainnet

3. **Learn & Improve**
   - Take notes on what works
   - Learn from any issues
   - Keep improving gradually

## Progress Tracking üìä
### Week 1-2: Devnet
- [ ] Complete all devnet testing
- [ ] Document all working features
- [ ] Prepare for mainnet

### Week 3-4: Mainnet
- [ ] Small mainnet tests
- [ ] Strategy implementation
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### Week 5-6: ML Start
- [ ] Data collection
- [ ] Basic ML setup
- [ ] Initial training

## Remember üåü
- Test everything multiple times
- Start small and scale up
- Keep good documentation
- Take your time
- Safety first!
