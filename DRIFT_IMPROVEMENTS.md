# Drift Handler Improvements

## Key Changes Made

1. **Better Connection Management**
   - Added proper `start()` and `stop()` methods
   - Implemented async context managers (`__aenter__`, `__aexit__`)
   - Added cleanup for WebSocket connections

2. **Market Fetching Improvements**
   - Enhanced `_get_markets_sdk()` with multiple approaches and fallbacks
   - Added fallback to hardcoded markets when API fails
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. **Market Validation**
   - Implemented proper `validate_market()` method
   - Added storage of available markets in `_available_markets` attribute
   - Added normalization of market symbols

4. **Testing Improvements**
   - Added `self_test()` method for standalone testing
   - Created MockDriftHandler for reliable testing
   - Updated test file to handle async operations properly

## Current Issues

1. **RPC Connection Issues**
   - HTTP 429 errors (too many requests) from WebSocket connections
   - Some SDK methods failing with 410 Gone from the Solana API
   - Event loop management issues during tests

## Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement exponential backoff for RPC calls
   - Consider using a connection pool to limit concurrent connections

2. **Test Reliability**
   - Use mock data for tests that don't require actual network connections
   - Add specific test fixtures for different failure scenarios

3. **Drift SDK Usage**
   - Consider using a more direct approach with the SDK
   - Add more fallback mechanisms for different SDK methods

4. **Error Handling**
   - Ensure all async operations have proper try/except blocks
   - Add more contextual information in error messages

## Testing Your Changes

To verify your drift functionality:

1. Run the standalone test:
   ```
   python src/critical_tests/run_drift_test.py
   ```

2. Or use the pytest framework:
   ```
   PYTHONPATH=/home/dex/ultimate_data_fetcher/src pytest src/critical_tests/test_critical_functionality.py::TestCriticalExchangeFunctionality::test_drift_basic_functionality -v
   ```

3. For debugging, you can add a simple script that just tests market validation:
   ```python
   from exchanges.drift import DriftHandler
   from core.config import ExchangeConfig
   
   # Create a config
   config = ExchangeConfig(name="drift", ...)
   
   # Test market validation
   handler = DriftHandler(config)
   handler._available_markets = ["SOL-PERP", "BTC-PERP", "ETH-PERP"]
   assert handler.validate_market("SOL-PERP")
   print("Market validation works!")
   ```
